This should all work, I uploaded the basic code because I am not 100% sure of the due date but I will keep working on this to make it more user friendly
-nP creates a new private key value for the current user
-eU will edit/create a user and their key
-enc will encrypt a file 
when prompted what user you want to save a public key under -NA will indicate that you don't wish to save the key
-dec will decrypt a file
